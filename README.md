# Customer-Segmentation
This is an Analysis where the Customers in the Mall are segmented based on Annual Income and Spending score. This is a segmentation problem so we use unsupervised Algorithms such as K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms to group people.

Attributes:
1. Customer Id
2. Gender
3. Age
4. Annual Income (k$)
5. Spending Score (1-100)
Insights:
1) Group 1 (Dark Blue): People in the group do not have high income but they have good spending score.
2) Group 2 (Green): People in the group have very low income and also very low spending score. People with less income tend to purchase less in supermarkets and malls.
3) Group 3 (Pink): People in the group have high income but they have very less spending score. People in the group are very cautious about what they are buying.
4) Group 4 (Yellow): People in the group have average income and average spending score.
5) Group 5 (Red): People in the group have high income and high spending score.
Suggestions:
1) Mall can give offers to the people who are not buying too much.
2) For Group 2 and group 3 people the mall can give discounts and offers using membership cards, so that they tend to buy more products in the mall which increases profit to the mall and brings customer satisfaction.
